#NB NB - use docker compose config to see template - this is like helm template

#think of this as your system deployment (kompose has generated the yaml based on this0
#it will generate the encrypt container  and the decrypt container (with dependency on encrypt)
#and the shared volume object called outputdata
#in k8s containers become pods
#a volume object is like a disk space alloacted by docker (or K8s) i.e. Docker (or K8s) mount it in the file system
# the user can mount the volume in the container file system by specifiying a volumemount name and path
#and when mounted the two directories are linked
#the volumemount is described inside the container level and volume on same level as
#container (i dont know why the ecrypt-deployment.yml has no volumemount for volume output data
#or has no bind volume in it)
version: '3.2'
#env variables for the docker compose  will be defined in the.env file
#env variables for the container (running image) will be in env-file
#Kompose will generate the required yaml files from this compose file - play with setup of valumes to see
#the difference in the yaml files generated
#windows is not using alias like in linux but use an env variable-call the variable like this %variable%
#the Kompose exe is run by typing %kompose% (kompose-windows-amd64) at CLI-i used variable set kompose=kompose-windows-amd64
#then at CLI type %kompose% convert -f ../docker-compose.yml
#for some reason decrypt is not working with compose - it runs fine in docker build and docker run
#i was trying to use the named volume but could not locate the docker volume mount to check the results
# therefore did not use the volume /outputdata-NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS
#using local mappimg is fine for testing but a shared volume (managed by docker or K8s) is necessary to deploy the
#app in any system ... local mappings ( bind volumes) here wont work on a cloud deployment for example-so how to pass in input data ?
#after using kompose convert i am deploying to minikube with
#kubectl apply -f encrypt-deployment.yaml,decrypt-deployment.yaml,env_file-configmap.yaml,outputdatavolume-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml
#thereis %kompose% up/down etc  like with docker compose up/down/build but this is not working (its not necessary)
#latest is that the pods are not coming up due to a scheduler issue ???
#the goal here is to deploy with the input data in config file and to edit the config with a new file as required

#containers can share data via volumes
#the named volumes are used for sharing generated data-docker decides where the volume is mounted i.e where the actual storage location
#on the computer is - the location in the image can be specified in the compose so then docker will map or mount the
#image directory to the same directory on computer the outputdata from encrypt app
#must goto a shared volume - this concept is called a PVC in k8s or persistent volume claim - if outputdata is a pvc then the images can be s
#stopped and restarted and the contents of the directory (on computer) for the volume outputdata will still exist
#the bind volume is used for passing in data-programmer decides where the volume is mounted
#bind volumes are not common in k8s - you normally pass in files using a configmap

        # WHEM MAKING THE DEPLOYMENT YOU CAN PASS IN THE VAR USING --SET VALUES.FILELOCATION=XXXX
        #THe key point is that the yaml cannot have variables in it when generated
        # it should be possible to pass in a paramater to Kompose which will generate the yaml
        #paramater such as  kompose .... --set inputdata=C:\Users\NeuedaSupport\PycharmProjects\NeuedaTaskfinal\data

      #this volume mapping is working !!! its the same as bind volume - this is fine for testing but for a cloud deployment
